.SYNOPSIS
Invokes Pester to run all tests (files containing *Tests.ps1) recursively under the Path

.DESCRIPTION
Upon calling Invoke-Pester. All files that have a name containing 
"*Tests.ps1" will have there tests defined in their Describe blocks 
executed. Invoke-Pester begins at the location of Path and 
runs recursively through each sub directory looking for 
*Tests.ps1 files for tests to run. If a TestName is provided, 
Invoke-Pester will only run tests that have a describe block with a 
matching name. By default, Invoke-Pester will end the test run with a 
simple report of the number of tests passed and failed output to the 
console. One may want pester to "fail a build" in the event that any 
tests fail. To accomodate this, Invoke-Pester will return an exit 
code equal to the number of failed tests if the EnableExit switch is 
set. Invoke-Pester will also write a NUnit style log of test results 
if the OutputXml parameter is provided. In these cases, Invoke-Pester 
will write the result log to the path provided in the OutputXml 
parameter.

Optionally, Pester can generate a report of how much code is covered
by the tests, and information about any commands which were not
executed.

.PARAMETER Path
The path where Invoke-Pester begins to search for test files. The default is the current directory. Aliased 'relative_path' for backwards compatibility.

.PARAMETER TestName
Informs Invoke-Pester to only run Describe blocks that match this name.

.PARAMETER EnableExit
Will cause Invoke-Pester to exit with a exit code equal to the number of failed tests once all tests have been run. Use this to "fail" a build when any tests fail.

.PARAMETER OutputXml
The path where Invoke-Pester will save a NUnit formatted test results log file. If this path is not provided, no log will be generated.

.PARAMETER Tag 
Informs Invoke-Pester to only run Describe blocks tagged with the tags specified. Aliased 'Tags' for backwards compatibility.

.PARAMETER PassThru
Returns a Pester result object containing the information about the whole test run, and each test.

.PARAMETER CodeCoverage
Instructs Pester to generate a code coverage report in addition to running tests.  You may pass either hashtables or strings to this parameter.
If strings are used, they must be paths (wildcards allowed) to source files, and all commands in the files are analyzed for code coverage.
By passing hashtables instead, you can limit the analysis to specific lines or functions within a file.
Hashtables must contain a Path key (which can be abbreviated to just "P"), and may contain Function (or "F"), StartLine (or "S"), and EndLine ("E") keys to narrow down the commands to be analyzed.
If Function is specified, StartLine and EndLine are ignored.
If only StartLine is defined, the entire script file starting with StartLine is analyzed.
If only EndLine is present, all lines in the script file up to and including EndLine are analyzed.
Both Function and Path (as well as simple strings passed instead of hashtables) may contain wildcards.

.Example
Invoke-Pester

This will find all *Tests.ps1 files and run their tests. No exit code will be returned and no log file will be saved.

.Example
Invoke-Pester ./tests/Utils*

This will run all tests in files under ./Tests that begin with Utils and alsocontains .Tests.

.Example
Invoke-Pester -TestName "Add Numbers"

This will only run the Describe block named "Add Numbers"

.Example
Invoke-Pester -EnableExit -OutputXml "./artifacts/TestResults.xml"

This runs all tests from the current directory downwards and writes the results according to the NUnit schema to artifatcs/TestResults.xml just below the current directory. The test run will return an exit code equal to the number of test failures.

.EXAMPLE
Invoke-Pester -CodeCoverage 'ScriptUnderTest.ps1'

Runs all *.Tests.ps1 scripts in the current directory, and generates a coverage report for all commands in the "ScriptUnderTest.ps1" file.

.EXAMPLE
Invoke-Pester -CodeCoverage @{ Path = 'ScriptUnderTest.ps1'; Function = 'FunctionUnderTest' }

Runs all *.Tests.ps1 scripts in the current directory, and generates a coverage report for all commands in the "FunctionUnderTest" function in the "ScriptUnderTest.ps1" file.

.EXAMPLE
Invoke-Pester -CodeCoverage @{ Path = 'ScriptUnderTest.ps1'; StartLine = 10; EndLine = 20 }

Runs all *.Tests.ps1 scripts in the current directory, and generates a coverage report for all commands on lines 10 through 20 in the "ScriptUnderTest.ps1" file.
