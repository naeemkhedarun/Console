function Test-Identity

    .SYNOPSIS
    Tests that a name is a valid Windows local or domain user/group.
    
    .DESCRIPTION
    Attempts to convert an identity name into a `System.Security.Principal.SecurityIdentifer` object.  If the conversion succeeds, the name belongs to a valid local or domain user/group.  If conversion fails, the user/group doesn't exist. You can also optionally return the applicable `SecurityIdentifier` object.
    
    If the identity testing is in another domain, and there is no trust relationship between the current domain the identity's domain, `$false` will be returned even though the account could exist.
    
    .EXAMPLE
    Test-Identity -Name 'Administrators
    
    Tests that a user or group called `Administrators` exists on the local computer.
    
    .EXAMPLE
    Test-Identity -Name 'CARBON\Testers'
    
    Tests that a group called `Testers` exists in the `CARBON` domain.
    
    .EXAMPLE
    Test-Identity -Name 'Tester' -PassThru
    
    Tests that a user or group named `Tester` exists and returns a `System.Security.Principal.SecurityIdentifier` object if it does.
